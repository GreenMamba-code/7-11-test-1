A 7/11 has recently opened up in the area which sells various fruits. The problem is that they have no computer system that records the check-out process. This is a problem and they need assistance. 
They have politely requested that YOU write them a small application that can take care of this issue.
List of fruit and their price per 1 item:
Banana: R12.48
Apple: R9.00
Kiwi: R13
Mango: R14
Grapes: R6.07
Oranges: R45.23
Peaches: R54.00
Plums: R24.21

Question 1:
The owners need to record all their fruit and prices into the computer program. Create a python dictionary that records the fruit type and their price based on the list provided.

Question 2:
The owners requested a function is created that allows them to query a specific fruits price. This program needs to ask them a question in regards to what fruit they want to know about and return its price. If an invalid price is provided, an error must be returned. Call this function “fruit_query”. 

Question 3:
The owners have requested another function is created which allows them to change the price of a specific fruit. This program needs to ask them a question in regards to what fruit they want to change – it needs to accept the new price and store it was a FLOAT type as well as have a confirmation feature. (Type “yes” to confirm). The function must return if the change was successful or not. Call this function “fruit_price_update”.

Question 4: 
The owners need more help! They need a function that dynamically calculates the total value of their fruit dictionary (takes all the dictionary values (prices)) and returns back the total amount in a FLOAT type. Call this function “stock_price_total”.

Question 5:
A lady has just walked in and has purchased 2 fruits. A mango and banana, dynamically based on the name of the fruit – calculate the total price she is eligible to pay in a FLOAT type. Call this function “checkout”.

Your code should return correctly and not output any errors.

Question 6:
Submit a pull request to the GitHub repo you collect this test from. Submit your code including your functions for collaborative review.
